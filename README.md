# üëã Hi, I'm [Selda Bayman]

## üöÄ About Me
I am a Junior Data Analyst with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My journey in data analysis started with a curiosity about how data can drive decision-making, leading me to learn  Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. Over time, I've completed several projects that highlight my analytical skills and ability to tell compelling data stories. My mission is to uncover actionable insights from data and create impactful, visually compelling reports.

## üõ† Skills
- **Excel**: Excel formulas, complex calculations and data manipulation,data cleaning etc.
- **SQL**: Complex queries, window functions, data aggregation
- **Python**: Data manipulation with Pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, statistical analysis
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards, DAX for data modeling, report sharing

## üìö My Learning Journey

## Excel
Excel was one of the first tools I used to analyze and visualize data. I learned how to organize datasets, apply advanced formulas, and create dynamic pivot tables to uncover trends. Through hands-on practice and courses like [Kodlasam], I built strong skills in leveraging Excel for reporting and data-driven decision-making.

### SQL
SQL was the next tool I mastered after Excel, taking my data analysis skills to a deeper level. It allowed me to efficiently manipulate and retrieve large datasets directly from databases. Through courses like [Kodlasam] on [DataCamp], I learned how to write complex queries, perform data aggregation, join tables, and cleanse data for analysis. SQL became a foundational skill that enhanced my ability to analyze data in structured environments.

### Python
Next, I explored Python, a versatile language crucial for data analysis. Through the [Kodlasam on [Data Camp], I learned data manipulation using Pandas, creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and performing statistical analysis.

### Power BI
To visualize my analyses, I turned to Power BI. The [Kodlasam] on [Data Camp] taught me how to create interactive dashboards, use DAX for data modeling, and present insights effectively.
