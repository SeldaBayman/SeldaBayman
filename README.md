# 👋 Hi, I'm [Selda Bayman]

## 🚀 About Me
I am a Junior Data Analyst with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My journey in data analysis started with a curiosity about how data can drive decision-making, leading me to learn  Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. Over time, I've completed several projects that highlight my analytical skills and ability to tell compelling data stories. My mission is to uncover actionable insights from data and create impactful, visually compelling reports.

## 🛠 Skills
- **Excel**: Excel formulas, complex calculations and data manipulation,data cleaning etc.
- **SQL**: Complex queries, window functions, data aggregation
- **Python**: Data manipulation with Pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, statistical analysis
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards, DAX for data modeling, report sharing

## 📚 My Learning Journey

### SQL
I began my data analysis journey with SQL, mastering the fundamentals of data manipulation and retrieval. Courses such as [Kodlasam] on [Data Camp] helped me develop skills in writing complex queries and performing data aggregation.

### Python
Next, I explored Python, a versatile language crucial for data analysis. Through the [Kodlasam on [Data Camp], I learned data manipulation using Pandas, creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and performing statistical analysis.

### Power BI
To visualize my analyses, I turned to Power BI. The [Kodlasam] on [Data Camp] taught me how to create interactive dashboards, use DAX for data modeling, and present insights effectively.
